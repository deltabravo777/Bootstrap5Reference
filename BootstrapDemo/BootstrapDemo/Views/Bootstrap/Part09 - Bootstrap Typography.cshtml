    Bootstrap Typography
    ----------------------------------------------
    Bootstrap Typography makes it easy to create headings, paragraphs, ordered lists, unordered lists,
    inline elements etc in a way that would be appearling to the users

    !heading h1-h6 does not start a new line if they are in a class="row"

    Bootstrap also has classes from h1 through h6. these classes are useful when you want to match the font styling of a heading
    but still want your text to be displayed inline

    To create a lighter secondary text along with the main text in any heading, use either <small> tag or the .small class
    ! this is text-muted for bootstrap5

<div class="container">
    <div>
        <h1>Heading 1</h1><br />
        <h2>Heading 2</h2><br />
        <h3>Heading 3</h3><br />
        <h4>Heading 4</h4><br />
        <h5>Heading 5</h5><br />
        <h6>Heading 6</h6><br />
    </div>

        <!-- this h4 element is a block element and not inline with the rest of the texzt -->
        <h4>Bootstrap</h4>, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as
        a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development,
        which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:
        A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something
        more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended
        up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.[3]
        After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week,
        a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an open source
        project on August 19, 2011.[4] It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as
        well as a large community of contributors.
